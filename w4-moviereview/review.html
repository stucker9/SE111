                        "Glengarry Glen Ross" is a classic film in my opinion that shows the cut-throat world of real estate sales. The film features a memorable cast, including Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, and Jonathan Pryce, who deliver standout performances. The tension between the salesmen is palpable and the film does an excellent job of showing the lengths they will go to in order to close a deal.

                        The film is a masterclass in character development and storytelling. Each of the salesmen has their own unique motivations, quirks, and flaws, making them feel like real people rather than caricatures. The dialogue is sharp, witty, and often very funny, with some memorable lines that have since become part of pop culture. The film's climax is particularly tense and satisfying, with a twist that will leave audiences on the edge of their seats. Overall, "Glengarry Glen Ross" is a must-watch for fans of drama and character-driven films. It's a shame it's not more well-known but in a way makes it kind of special.
